//Calculator class is limited and not implemented on backend of the app. Ideally need to be re-implemented (whnever i have time for that)

export class Calculator {
  constructor(id, name, type, data, timeCreated, latitude, longitude) {
    this.id = id
    this.name = name
    this.type = type
    this.data = data
    this.timeCreated = timeCreated
    this.latitude = latitude
    this.longitude = longitude
  }
}
